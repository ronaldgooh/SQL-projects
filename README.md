## Introduction

Data analysis is fundamental to informed decision-making, and SQL offers a robust platform for executing diverse data analysis tasks. This repository aims to showcase a variety of SQL projects that illustrate the data analysis process, spanning from data retrieval to the presentation of insights.

## Projects

1. **COVID-19**
   - [Project 1](https://github.com/ronaldgooh/SQL-projects/blob/main/SQL%20Data%20Exploration-%20covid19/Data%20Exploration%20-%20COVID19.sql): 
This project initiates by gathering data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/). The collected data is then seamlessly imported into SQL Server Management Studio for in-depth analysis. The analysis encompasses querying and exploring health statistics data, scrutinizing key metrics such as infection rates, mortality rates, vaccination percentages, and more. Dive into the provided SQL queries and visualizations to glean valuable insights into the prevalence of health-related factors and their interrelationships.

2. **Apple app store**
   - [Project 2](https://github.com/ronaldgooh/SQL-projects/blob/main/SQL%20Data%20Exploration-%20Apple%20app%20store/PRACTICAL%20Data%20Analytics%20with%20SQL%20-%20Apple%20Store.sql):
This project conducts a thorough analysis of Apple App Store data to derive valuable insights into app performance. By seamlessly importing data into SQL Server Management Studio, the focus lies on comparing ratings between free and paid apps, investigating the correlation between language support and app ratings, and pinpointing genres with lower-rated apps and many more. Leveraging SQL queries, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of user preferences and the dynamics within the Apple App Store.
