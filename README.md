   - [Project 1](https://github.com/ronaldgooh/SQL-projects/blob/main/SQL%20Data%20Exploration-%20covid19/Data%20Exploration%20-%20COVID19.sql): 
This project initiates by gathering data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/). The collected data is then seamlessly imported into SQL Server Management Studio for in-depth analysis. The analysis encompasses querying and exploring health statistics data, scrutinizing key metrics such as infection rates, mortality rates, vaccination percentages, and more. Dive into the provided SQL queries and visualizations to glean valuable insights into the prevalence of health-related factors and their interrelationships.
